INTRODUCTION
============

Script that is an extension to URLCrazy (by  Andrew Horton -
http://www.morningstarsecurity.com/research/urlcrazy) that 
attempts to do some of the leg work/validation after getting
results of URLCrazy.

FEATURES
========

The following script was written to automate the validation
process of results generated by using URLCrazy. The script 
completes the following tasks:
 
  <OL>
  <LI>Runs a default URLCrazy session agains a provided domain<br>
  <LI>Resulting domains that resolve are then:<br>
  <UL>
  <LI>Submitted to a Whois check<br>
  <LI>Arin lookups are done on the resolved IP address<br>
  <LI>Screen captures are then taken of the site<br>
  </UL>
  </OL>

CONSIDERATIONS
==============
<OL>
<LI>You need to supply your own Snapito API key http://snapito.com/paid-api.jsp.<br>
   Edit the script and place the key inbetween the quotes.

<LI>Unless URLCrazy is in your PATH, you will need to edit the script and <br>
   place the path to your urlcrazy (ex. "/pentest/urlcrazy-x.x/").
	
<LI>The following perl modules are used:<br>
   IO::File
</OL>
Finally, being a perl script, the script should run on almost any 
platform. The script was though written and tested on Ubuntu 12.x.

USAGE
=====

Running this script:

Usage:

	perl DDSquat.pl <domain>

	Exmaple:
	perl DDSquat.pl abc.com

 End result will be a report file (<domain_ddsquat_rpt.html>) and png 
 images placed within the <domain>_imgs folder of the directory you ran
 the script from. Images will be named after the domain they were taken
 for (ex. abc.com.png).
